# Netlify Build Requirements
# This file contains ONLY packages needed for the build process
# The Netlify Functions are Node.js and don't need Python dependencies
# The heavy ML packages (PyTorch, FAISS, etc.) are for local Flask server only

# No Python packages needed for static site build
# All logic is in Netlify Functions (Node.js)
